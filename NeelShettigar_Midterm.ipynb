    "This program lets you track how you spend your time, (Productive, Unproductive, or Neutral). The program will show you (outputs) how you are currently spending your time along with the percentages of your total time, and it will ask you (input) if you want to switch it, or end the program. Enter either the full word (Productive, Unproductive, or Neutral), or just the capital first letter, and make sure to leave the program running when you want to track time (don't close out of the tab).\n",

    "I got inspiration to make this program from a product called TimeFlip2. It is a simple time tracker that I've been meaning to buy, however held off due to its high price. I thought writing a program to simulate its purpouse will allow me to see if I would actually use it everyday, if it would actually help keep me on track, and possibly eliminate the need to buy it- if I further build upon this program.
